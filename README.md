# Portfolio

### [Deployed Site](https://bakportfolio.netlify.app/)

## Abstract
This application was created as a basic portfolio website to showcase a number of projects I've worked on and provide an overview of who I am. It also lists the basic tech/languages I'm familiar with in a 'Skills' page, and provides a 'Contact' page with links to my LinkedIn and GitHub. I plan on adding additional projects as they are completed and will implement new features as well.

Also, this app was initialized in [another repo](https://github.com/bkuhn2/BAK-Portfolio) but was migrated here due to a Git versioning issue. It will be maintained from this repo going forward, but the older repo will have the prior commit/branch history that may be of interest.
